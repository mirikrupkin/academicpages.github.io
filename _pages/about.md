I am a postdoc in [the Puglisi lab](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/miri-krupkin), at Stanford University, where I study the regulatory role of RNA structures in HIV infection. My passion is to reveal the molecular basis of infectious diseases and to expand our understanding of antibiotics and antiviral drugs. 

Background
======
Originally, I was trained as a chemist during my BSc. I completed my PhD under the mentorship of [Professor Ada Yonath](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sb/Pages/Yonath/), at the Weizmann Institute of Science, focusing on the ribosome structure, function, and evolution. I elucidated the activity, selectivity, and resistance mechanisms of [avilamycin](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/44/E6796), a ribosomal polysaccharide antibiotics. In addition, I proposed a novel hypothesis that the ribosome has evolved from the [pre-proto-ribosome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158926/), a molecular machine capable of performing essential tasks in the RNA world.

Other Interests
======
I am devoted to promoting science education and outreach. 
In my spare time, I love to do yoga.
