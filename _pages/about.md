I have always been fascinated by the beauty of nature and curious to learn more about it. I was hypnotized by the structures of macromolecules during my grad studies, and became eager to understand more about the chemistry of life. My passion is to reveal the molecular basis of infectious diseases, and expand our understanding of human health. 

Background
======
Originally, I trained as a chemist for my Bachelor of Science degree, at Bar Ilan University (Israel). 

I completed my PhD under the mentorship of [Professor Ada Yonath](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sb/Pages/Yonath/), at the Weizmann Institute of Science, focusing on the ribosome structure, function, and evolution. I elucidated the activity, selectivity, and resistance mechanisms of [avilamycin](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/44/E6796), a ribosomal polysaccharide antibiotics. In addition, I proposed a novel hypothesis that the ribosome has evolved from the [pre-proto-ribosome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158926/), a molecular machine capable of performing essential tasks in the RNA world. 

I am currently a postdoc in [the Puglisi lab](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/miri-krupkin), at Stanford University, where I study the regulatory role of RNA structures in HIV infection. 

Other Interests
======
I am devoted to promoting science education and outreach. 
In my spare time, I love to do yoga.
