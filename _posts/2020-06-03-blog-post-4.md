Back in February I attended the [The 2020 Bay Area cryoEM meeting](https://www.gatan.com/company/events/bay-area-cryo-em-meeting). The meeting covers everything from cryoEM sample prep to analysis and modeling. The conference also featured some of the new exciting structures solved by the bay area labs. The meeting took place back when we could have in person gathering, and was hosted by Gatan. I got to see old friends and it was really nice to match a face to the names I new from scientific papers. I even caught a ride there and back with new friends! Here are a few highlights from the meeting I put together for you. 

**Highlights:**

  * Sample prep and cryoEM tools:
    * Avinash Patel from the Nogales lab explained Graphene Oxide grids and collecting Tilted Data.
    * Feng Wang from the Yifan and Aagard labs explained about Graphene Oxide based EM grids.
    * Leeya Engel from Dunn lab explained micropatterning of ECM proteins on EM greeds for designed cell placements.
    * Max Armstrong from the Fletcher and the Glaese labs showed what is happening during blotting. 
  * Strucutre validation and modeling:
    * Oleg Sobolev explained about structure validation and modeling, and what is ramaZ.
    * Pavel Afonine expanded more about Phenix for cryoEM maps, modeling, and validation. Composite maps and sharpening.
    * Greg Pintilie from Chiu lab introduced about Qscore, which quantified atomic resolution.
  * New structures:
    * Hanzhi Zhang from the Zhou lab talked about potassium  ion channels required for bacterial growth. TrkA, TrkH, and #ATP. 
    * Stefan Oliver from the Arvin lab described viral glycoproteins of Herpes Virus. virology. 
    * Maria Maldonado from the Letts lab presented the plant Respiratory Complexes and mETC. plants biology. 
    * Simon Fromm from the Hurley lab talked about Rag GTPase activation. Lysosomal Follicul in Complex.
    * Alpay Seven from the Skiniotis lab described Quality Control of GPCR.
    * Kyle Lopez from the Southworth lab presented the ClpAP protease structure.
