I did a podcast with "Talking Science", an Israeli science podcast by [@MadaGadol](https://twitter.com/MadaGadol). Listen in to learn about HIV, the importance of developing new drugs for HIV, and future directions in HIV therapy. 

[Link to podcast](https://lbscience.podbean.com/e/פרק-46-דרמירי-קרופקיןתעצרו-את/). The podcast is in Hebrew.
