In the begining of March I attended the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections also known as CROI 2020. It was fantastic! Especially in light of the last minute change to a virtual platform due to the covid19 pandemic. All of the lectures are online now, so here's a few lectures that I think you should check out!
