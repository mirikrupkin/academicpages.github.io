I love to lie on the grass loutside, especially when its sunny. But since shelter at home was issued I wanted to bring some of the green into my home. I wanted something easy and sustainable, without ordering anything new, so I decided to grow my garden from food scraps. I made a quick "how to" for you to grow your own shelter at home garden.
