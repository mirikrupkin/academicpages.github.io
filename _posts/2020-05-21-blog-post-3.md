This week I attended the virtual [CSH Retroviruses virtual meeting](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=RETRO&year=20). The meeting goes through the retrovirus lifecycle, starting from viral cell entry till release. The meeting was great and here are a few highlights I put together for you. 

**Published highlights:**

  *  Capsid Uncoating and Nuclear Entry
      * Ryan Burdick from the Pathak lab reveals that nuclear uncoating of HIV-1 occures near sites of integration, [read more at PNAS 2020](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/10/5486).
      * Mirijana Persaud from the Diaz-Griffero lab explains how Cyclophilin A prevents TRIM5Î± restriction of HIV, [read more at Cell Reports 2020](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)30274-6).
  *  Accessory Protein and Antagonism of Restriction Factors
      * Molly Ohainle from the [Emerman lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/emerman/en.html) presents how TRIM34 restricts HIV with capsid mutant N74D, [read more at PLOS Pathogens 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008507). 
      * Molly McDonnell from the [Emerman lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/emerman/en.html) talks about super restriction factors and double domains of APOBEC3, [read more at mBio 2020](https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/2/e00737-20). 
      * [Ruth Serra- Moreno](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/serra-moreno.aspx) illuminates how Nef counteracts autophagy restriction of HIV, [read more at Autophagy 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15548627.2020.1725401). 
  *  Reverse Transcription and Integration
      * Very exciting talks! But most of them are still unpublished. I'm looking forward to reading them when they are out! 
  * Fantastic keynote by Anna Maria Skalka. It was so fascinating to learn about her work in phages, retroviruses, integrase, protease, recombination, reversetranscription, and RNAviruses. On a personal note her success story is what gives me hope and excitement about our future.
