Hi Postdocs, 

Lately, while working from home during the Shelter-in-Place order in California, I wanted to meet new people. With new virtual apps for meetings, I saw how we can connect with scientists around the world from the comfort of home. And with some of the conferences not having a great gender balance, I felt that I want to meet more female postdocs and hear more about their cool science. [Women benefit from female led networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07878-w), but especially now as we are socially distancing, it can be hard to form new connections. So, I thought maybe I can start small, and create a network between all the female postdocs that I know. Then if you like it, you could invite your friends too. I chose the word postdociot, which is the Hebrew word for female postdocs. Join us to meet and network with other postdocs that are also women.
